# Job-Board

The aim of this project is to develop a job board website using Node.js and Express.js with NoSQL database. The website will allow job seekers to search for job openings and apply for them, while employers can post their job vacancies and manage applications.

The website will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the site. The homepage will display featured jobs, recent job postings, and popular categories. Users can also search for jobs by keyword, location, category, or company name.

Job seekers can create an account on the website where they can upload their resume, cover letter, and other relevant documents. They can also save their favorite jobs and receive email notifications when new jobs are posted that match their criteria.

Employers can create an account on the website where they can post their job vacancies. They can also manage applications from candidates, view resumes, and communicate with applicants through the platform.

The website will be developed using Node.js and Express.js with a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or Firebase. The front-end will be developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with a responsive design that works on all devices.

Overall, this project aims to provide a platform for both job seekers and employers to connect in an efficient and effective manner. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, this job board website will help users find the right opportunities while helping employers find the right candidates for their open positions.
